        <h1 id="why-researcharium">Why Researcharium?</h1>

<p>Researcharium is an initiative started by two researchers in ICT with accumulated 24 years of experience paving their way in the academic research arena. It is the result of endless discussions about what it is to do academic research in the first quarter of the 21st century.<br />
Our objective with Researcharium is to share observations, lessons we learnt and things we believe could happen differently on the reality of working as a researcher beyond our little bubble of friends and colleagues.
Forget about the idea of one sitting in a lab all day focusing on getting ideas out! We hope Researcharium to be a starting point for anyone interested in going beyond the myth of the research ladderâ€™s life.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-use-researcharium">How to use Researcharium?</h1>

<p>Researcharium is a series of brief notes / short articles on the different aspects of the daily routine of doing research. Taken together it gives a perspective of everything a researcher has to deal with.
Each article provides an overview of an activity and shares some informed experience in the work it requires, and skills it helps developing.
Researcharium is a report of experience, and while every item aims at describing a non-biased version of what a researcher does, it comes with our perception as researchers based in the UK and working in an academic institution.</p>
