        <h1>Jobs of a Researcher</h1>
<ul>
    
      <li>
        <h2>Clerk</h2>
        <p><p>It might not be obvious at first, but working as a researcher involves having quite a bit of admin-related work’s obligations. Put in a slightly different way, to do research comes with spending a non-negligible amount of time on sorting administrative tasks. These can be quite diverse, from booking internal meeting rooms or to arranging business trips and filling in what looks like a never ending list of random forms (whose purpose and readership often remain pretty obscure). 
Some might of course find enjoyment in the art of filling in paper work. Wherever one lies on the spectrum of taking pleasure from clerk work, it is not a myth that these activities can rapidly turn out to absorb too much of our precious time.  <br />
For the fun of going through the accounting bureaucracy, navigating event registration’s systems, and determining what on earth this random item on the business trip reimbursement form is meant for, please take a look at the researcher clerk articles!</p>
</p>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p><p>Researchers in general and in their specific domain, respectively, are members of the so-called community. The community is defined from the association of people who share a set of common interests in matters that make our understanding of the world move forward.
There is not a single community. Each discipline, each area, each domain, has its own community. The community follows rules and practices that are generally fixed by its members. Researchers are both actors and participants of the community. They help shape its rules, contribute to its dynamics, and define how the community co-exist within and with other communities. 
It is up to each researcher to decide which involvement to have in the community. One can choose to be an active contributor, by organising events, for instance, by coordinating the publications of specialised books and journals, by raising funds to support the community’s members. Others may decide to limit their involvement to non-active contribution, such as through the production of artifacts, including papers, reports, codes, research tools, etc. 
The community is a central element of the researcher’s job. This category is about community involvement, and all the goods and bads that it entails.</p>

        <h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
        <p><p>This is not an activity that comes to mind when one thinks about being a researcher. It is however increasingly important for researchers to consider themselves entrepreneurs. This is a consequence of the increasingly competitive environment in which researchers find themselves, and beyond the obvious debate regarding whether a researcher should be burdened with tasks other than the production of new knowledge - which we’ll cover in the first blog post -  there is the irrefutable hard reality of the number of PhD graduates versus the number of academic roles available. Hence, the basic supply and demand dynamics in academia mean that the pressure put on researchers to differentiate themselves cannot be solved on an individual level through a philosophical debate about what is desirable or not. 
The blog posts of this section will cover the entrepreneurship aspect of being a researcher today. This will mostly apply to the UK where we derive our experience but it is likely that the experience of researchers around the world bear many similarities.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A competitive environment for researchers
 In this article we discuss the current context in research and the behaviours that we see emerge in academia as a result. Principally the rise of the personal brand in research and the drive towards commercialisation of research output.</li>
  <li>The ambiguous position of Intellectual Property 
 This article will cover the ambiguous situation that can arise when public research meets private commercial interests. Namely, how do you marry open peer reviewed research with IP protection. This is a highly non-trivial issue as patents are often innovation killers but at the same time successful commercialisation materialises the research benefits to society on a faster timescale.</li>
  <li>Commercialisation of university research
 In this section we will discuss the process of commercialisation as we have experienced it, emphasising on the challenges encountered. The reader will hopefully be able to craft a better experience for themselves based on this example.</li>
</ol>

        <h2>Reader</h2>
        <p><p>In this section we are going to explore the principal activity of the researcher, at least on paper ;P.
This task is indeed reading ! This is a central task in the life of a researcher, and although it sounds like a simple thing for any literate person, in practice it does come with its fair share of challenges when you are doing it for the purpose of research!
We are going to explore various elements in this category, highlighting the problems faced by us researchers in the following 4 categories related to this activity.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Coping with literature
 Following the scientific literature is arguably the main reason reading is part of the job description of a role as researcher. It is required to acquire and maintain a good knowledge of the state of the art in any given field. But as we’ll discuss, the state of the literature poses many challenges and can be detrimental to the progress of the researcher.</li>
  <li>Enriching general knowledge
 Enriching general knowledge is obviously not limited to someone with “researcher” as their job title. However, being a researcher makes having solid general knowledge even more relevant as - we argue -  it allows to build bridges between disciplines and increases creativity.</li>
  <li>Following side development
 This task is somewhat related to the previous two. It touches upon the importance of understanding developments that are connected to your area of research without being a direct application. This is often where opportunities lie.</li>
  <li>Relax
 This is an odd one, isn’t it? Relaxing isn’t a task is it?
Given the main purpose of reading as a researcher, it is important to spend some time thinking about the approach of reading in this context. How do you read for research? What is the importance of daydreaming in this process?</li>
</ol>
</p>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <h2>Recruiter</h2>
        <p><p>This task is nowhere to be found in the job description of a researcher but of course as you grow in your career, you will have to build a research team for yourself or for your PI. We will discuss the specificities of this task in an academic context. The challenges encountered, the pros and cons of recruitment in academia and approaches available to help you with such a task.
The articles in this category are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Shortlisting candidates
 How to select the appropriate candidate for a role (PhD or Postdoc) when the pool of candidates is international and the standards vary so much from one country to another. How much weight does the number of publications have in the selection process?</li>
  <li>Interviewing candidates
 How to conduct interviews? That is not a question unique to academia of course but we will attempt to give our view of the topic from this perspective.</li>
  <li>The administrative process
 Nobody likes admin work, this seems even more the case at universities. It would seem universities are the slowest institutions still alive in the 21st century. Processes seem  to be engineered to take the longest time possible and unfortunately your time is scarce. We will discuss this topic but TLDR; plan ahead.</li>
</ol>

        <h2>Teacher</h2>
        <p><p>This is about teaching as a researcher.</p>
</p>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <h2>Technician</h2>
        <p><p>Depending on your area of research, this will be more or less important. But if you happen to be in an experimental field, chances are you will have to deal with a wide variety of equipment, some of which will operate in a manner that seems more akin to dark magic than science. In any case, you will need to become an expert in the operation and troubleshooting of that equipment which will be vital for your experiments and teaching. You will certainly also have to build new tools and write software to interface with that equipment otherwise it wouldn’t be called research and honestly, where would be the fun if it was all easy?
This section will be around the activities that need to be done as a researcher wearing the hat of a technician.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reviewing equipment features</li>
  <li>Learning new software</li>
  <li>Developing new software</li>
</ol>
</p>
      </li>
    
      <li>
        <h2>Trainer</h2>
        <p><p>It is the case for many professions that as one grows in experience one also participates in the training of those who will come after them. This is also true as a researcher, although in the case of research it is more accurate to refer to it as mentoring. Trainee researcher a.k.a PhD students are in fact researchers themselves as they focus on solving a problem for which the solution isn’t known by anybody, they will often quickly become experts and technically know more about their specific topic than their supervisor. In this context the training is done differently, one may even refer to it as a collaboration where someone with more experience provides guidance and specific expertise to someone else working to solve a problem.
In this section we will discuss</p>
<ol>
  <li>Supervising PhD students</li>
  <li>Working with research assistants</li>
  <li>Mentoring</li>
</ol>
</p>
