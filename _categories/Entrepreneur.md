This is not an activity that comes to mind when one thinks about being a researcher. It is however increasingly important for researchers to consider themselves entrepreneurs. This is a consequence of the increasingly competitive environment in which researchers find themselves, and beyond the obvious debate regarding whether a researcher should be burdened with tasks other than the production of new knowledge - which weâ€™ll cover in the first blog post -  there is the irrefutable hard reality of the number of PhD graduates versus the number of academic roles available. Hence, the basic supply and demand dynamics in academia mean that the pressure put on researchers to differentiate themselves cannot be solved on an individual level through a philosophical debate about what is desirable or not. 
The blog posts of this section will cover the entrepreneurship aspect of being a researcher today. This will mostly apply to the UK where we derive our experience but it is likely that the experience of researchers around the world bear many similarities. 


1. A competitive environment for researchers
	In this article we discuss the current context in research and the behaviours that we see emerge in academia as a result. Principally the rise of the personal brand in research and the drive towards commercialisation of research output.
2. The ambiguous position of Intellectual Property 
	This article will cover the ambiguous situation that can arise when public research meets private commercial interests. Namely, how do you marry open peer reviewed research with IP protection. This is a highly non-trivial issue as patents are often innovation killers but at the same time successful commercialisation materialises the research benefits to society on a faster timescale.   
3. Commercialisation of university research
	In this section we will discuss the process of commercialisation as we have experienced it, emphasising on the challenges encountered. The reader will hopefully be able to craft a better experience for themselves based on this example.
