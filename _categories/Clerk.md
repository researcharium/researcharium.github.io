It might not be obvious at first, but working as a researcher involves having quite a bit of admin-related work’s obligations.

Put in a slightly different way, to do research comes with spending a non-negligible amount of time on sorting administrative tasks. These can be quite diverse, from booking internal meeting rooms or to arranging business trips and filling in what looks like a never ending list of random forms (whose purpose and readership often remain pretty obscure). 
Some might of course find enjoyment in the art of filling in paper work. Wherever one lies on the spectrum of taking pleasure from clerk work, it is not a myth that these activities can rapidly turn out to absorb too much of our precious time.    
For the fun of going through the accounting bureaucracy, navigating event registration’s systems, and determining what on earth this random item on the business trip reimbursement form is meant for, please take a look at the researcher clerk articles!
