In this section we are going to explore the principal activity of the researcher, at least on paper ;P.
This task is indeed reading ! This is a central task in the life of a researcher, and although it sounds like a simple thing for any literate person, in practice it does come with its fair share of challenges when you are doing it for the purpose of research!
We are going to explore various elements in this category, highlighting the problems faced by us researchers in the following 4 categories related to this activity.
1. Coping with literature
	Following the scientific literature is arguably the main reason reading is part of the job description of a role as researcher. It is required to acquire and maintain a good knowledge of the state of the art in any given field. But as we’ll discuss, the state of the literature poses many challenges and can be detrimental to the progress of the researcher.
2. Enriching general knowledge
	Enriching general knowledge is obviously not limited to someone with “researcher” as their job title. However, being a researcher makes having solid general knowledge even more relevant as - we argue -  it allows to build bridges between disciplines and increases creativity.
3. Following side development
	This task is somewhat related to the previous two. It touches upon the importance of understanding developments that are connected to your area of research without being a direct application. This is often where opportunities lie. 
4. Relax
	This is an odd one, isn’t it? Relaxing isn’t a task is it?
Given the main purpose of reading as a researcher, it is important to spend some time thinking about the approach of reading in this context. How do you read for research? What is the importance of daydreaming in this process?
