name: Community

Researchers in general and in their specific domain, respectively, are members of the so-called community. The community is defined from the association of people who share a set of common interests in matters that make our understanding of the world move forward.
There is not a single community. Each discipline, each area, each domain, has its own community. The community follows rules and practices that are generally fixed by its members. Researchers are both actors and participants of the community. They help shape its rules, contribute to its dynamics, and define how the community co-exist within and with other communities. 
It is up to each researcher to decide which involvement to have in the community. One can choose to be an active contributor, by organising events, for instance, by coordinating the publications of specialised books and journals, by raising funds to support the community’s members. Others may decide to limit their involvement to non-active contribution, such as through the production of artifacts, including papers, reports, codes, research tools, etc. 
The community is a central element of the researcher’s job. This category is about community involvement, and all the goods and bads that it entails.
