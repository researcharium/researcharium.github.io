Depending on your area of research, this will be more or less important. But if you happen to be in an experimental field, chances are you will have to deal with a wide variety of equipment, some of which will operate in a manner that seems more akin to dark magic than to science. 

In any case, you will need to become an expert in the operation and troubleshooting of that equipment which will be vital for your experiments and teaching. You will certainly also have to build new tools and write software to interface with that equipment otherwise it wouldnâ€™t be called research and honestly, where would be the fun if it was all easy?
This section will be around the activities that need to be done as a researcher wearing the hat of a technician.
1. Reviewing equipment features
2. Learning new software
3. Developing new software
