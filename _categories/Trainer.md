It is the case for many professions that as one grows in experience one also participates in the training of those who will come after them. This is also true as a researcher, although in the case of research it is more accurate to refer to it as mentoring. Trainee researcher a.k.a PhD students are in fact researchers themselves as they focus on solving a problem for which the solution isnâ€™t known by anybody, they will often quickly become experts and technically know more about their specific topic than their supervisor. In this context the training is done differently, one may even refer to it as a collaboration where someone with more experience provides guidance and specific expertise to someone else working to solve a problem.
In this section we will discuss 
1. Supervising PhD students
2. Working with research assistants
