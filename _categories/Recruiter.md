This task is nowhere to be found in the job description of a researcher but of course as you grow in your career, you will have to build a research team for yourself or for your PI.

We will discuss the specificities of this task in an academic context. The challenges encountered, the pros and cons of recruitment in academia and approaches available to help you with such a task.
The articles in this category are:
1. Shortlisting candidates
	How to select the appropriate candidate for a role (PhD or Postdoc) when the pool of candidates is international and the standards vary so much from one country to another. How much weight does the number of publications have in the selection process? 
2. Interviewing candidates
	How to conduct interviews? That is not a question unique to academia of course but we will attempt to give our view of the topic from this perspective.   
3. The administrative process
	Nobody likes admin work, this seems even more the case at universities. It would seem universities are the slowest institutions still alive in the 21st century. Processes seem  to be engineered to take the longest time possible and unfortunately your time is scarce. We will discuss this topic but TLDR; plan ahead.
